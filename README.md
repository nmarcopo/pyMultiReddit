This was my first Python project! I think Dr. Bui did a great job introducing us to HTTP requests here, so that we wouldn't be too overwhelmed when we worked on our [final project](https://github.com/nmarcopo/spideyAndThor). All this really does is allow a user to look at a list of multiple subreddits' links at once, just like Reddit's MultiReddit feature.
